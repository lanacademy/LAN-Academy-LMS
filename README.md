## Built off Stacey 2.3.0
Stacey is a simple flat-file cms that takes content from `.txt` files, image files and implied directory structure and generates a website.

If you look in the `/content` and `/templates` folders, you should get the general idea of how it all works.

## Installation

Copy to server, `chmod 777 app/_cache`.

If you want clean urls, `mv htaccess .htaccess`

## Documentation

Stacey app's original documentation and more will be available on our wiki, right now it's in the content.
