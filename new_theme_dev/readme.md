What's not working:

I don't really like the slide plugin, I think I will use one that just hides itself on the right instead of the right sidebar hack that I'm using now. Functionality more like the right panel of constituteproject.org, though they're using angularjs.  

text.title isn't what I was hoping it would be, so currently all highlighted links contain "undefined" instead of their name. Also I don't know jquery. 

The left sidebar nav still needs to be created/styled. 

Bottom links still aren't mocked up/styled. 

It's still just an html file.
